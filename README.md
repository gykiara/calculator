# Microservice Calculator
Implement a microservice "Calculator" using maven + spring-boot.

This microservice exposes an API that is able, from some input parameters, to perform arithmetic operations. As it is a POC version, it is only capable of performing additions and subtractions of 2 elements (a,b), although it is foreseen that in future versions there will be other types of operations and of greater complexity. A library has been included that contains an API for tracing operations that is invoked from the microservice to trace the result of the operation.

# Requirements
Project created with:
1. Maven 4.0.0
2. JAVA OpenJDK 11
3. Spring-boot 2.7.14
